# Evaluation-of-factors-that-affect-and-predict-a-game-s-popularity-considering-its-sales-and-ratings
This research paper aims to apply five machine learning algorithms to three different data sets from the  Gaming and Entertainment industry to evaluate the various factors that possibly affect their popularity. These three data sets have been acquired from Kaggle and are based on the Games on Steam, Board Games, Apple App Store Strategy Games. Using the C5.0 Decision Tree and RIPPER Rule on Steam Games, Multiple Linear Regression and Model Tree M5-Prime on Board Games and Binary Logistic Regression on the Apple App Store Strategy Games data set, the popularity of these games has been predicted and various significant factors have been found. The number of owners and the average ratings of these games have been taken into consideration for predicting their popularity. Apart from applying these five machine learning algorithms on these three data sets a comparison was also considered between the two machine learning algorithms applied on each of the data sets except the Apple App Store Strategy Games. A very interesting observation in the Board Games data set was that as per Lantz B., the M5-Prime should perform better than a Multiple Linear Regression model but we found the complete opposite\cite{b1}. Also, the C5.0 Decision tree applied on the Steam games data set grew to a size of 176 branches but the RIPPER Rule only had 37 rules for the same dependent and independent variables. We will look deep into all these factors in the research paper using the KDD methodology of data mining to find answers.
